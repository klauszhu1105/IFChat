A modern online social app built with electron.

With the rapid development of the mobile Internet, the demand for instant messaging tools is increasing. Many existing clients are designed for specific platforms, which causes inconvenience to users. Electron-based instant messaging clients can solve this problem because Electron is a cross-platform framework that allows developers to build desktop-level software using front-end technologies such as Java Script and CSS. As a result, an instant messaging client developed with Electron can run on different operating system platforms and provide a unified instant messaging experience. Electron-based instant messaging clients also face some challenges, such as how to deal with cross-platform compatibility, how to achieve a stable network connection and how to ensure the security of user data.
In this paper, we use front-end technologies such as Java Script and CSS, combined with the Electron framework, to build an instant messaging tool that can run on multiple operating systems such as Windows, mac OS and Linux, realizing a truly cross-platform unified user experience. The main features of this system include user registration and login, contact management, one-to-one chat and group chat, file transfer and audio/video calls. The system supports text, pictures, emoticons and other message types, and integrates artificial intelligence dialog functions. The system provides users with customized settings, such as avatar and nickname. Users can also post in the Square module and send emails in the Post Office module. The system also has a built-in keyword extraction algorithm and user similarity algorithm to recommend matching users. In order to ensure the security of user data, the system adopts data encryption technology to guarantee communication security. In terms of technical implementation, this paper introduces in detail the application of key technologies such as Electron, Vue.js and Node.js, and data storage through My SQL database. The Electron framework combines the Chromium rendering engine and Node.js to enable developers to build native desktop applications using common Web technologies, thus simplifying the complexity of cross-platform development. The front-end uses Vue.js to improve development efficiency and code reusability, and the back-end uses Node.js and the Express framework to realize efficient server-side logic processing, which can provide users with a more convenient, efficient, and secure instant messaging experience, as well as provide developers with valuable experience and technical support in cross-platform application development.
